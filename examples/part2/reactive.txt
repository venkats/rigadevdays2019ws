Functional programming?
- immutability
- pure functions
- higher-order functions

But, what if functional programming really?
Functional composition + lazy evaluation

laziness leads to efficiency
laziness can't exist without functional purity 
	(or immutability)
	
Reactive programming builds on top of functional programming
	functional composition
	lazy evaluation
	synchronous vs. asynchronous computations
	backpressure

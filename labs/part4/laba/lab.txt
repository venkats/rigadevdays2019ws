A DroneLocator class (in drones.jar) has the following method:

DroneLocator.fetch(String droneID);

Calling this method will result in an Producer that will emit the location of the drone periodically.

For example, DroneLocator.fetch("DR01");

Subscribe to the Producer returned by fetch and print the location detail 
received. If the Producer terminates, report the completion of data emits. 
When the user keys in a "end" ask the Observable to stop emitting data.
